## Summary
high level summary of the results and 2 additional queries that I would perform to gather more weather data for June and December
Upon initial analysis I would conclude that it would be profitable to open a surf and ice cream shop on Oahu. The average temperature change from June to December is a minimal spread of 4 degrees. I would further analyze this data by querying first to determine why December has roughly 200 fewer temperature readings, and secondly, I would determine when the colder temperatures have occurred in December to see if there is an increasing or decreasing trend during that month over the last 10 years.
